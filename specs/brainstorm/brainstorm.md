# Brainstorm

## Design

* Drag-down menu for categories

* Select category -> list of related phrases

* For each phrase, give list of translations once selected

### UI

## Stack

* React for the user interface, is scalable if I want to expand LinguaFranca to a large web-app

* First develop as web-app, use Android Studio (XML and Java) for mobile application version later.
