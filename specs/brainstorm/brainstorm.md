## Stack

* Learn React for the user interface, is scalable if I want to expand LinguaFranca to a large web-app

* interested in learning Terraform, but do not think the scope of project is broad enough to justify using it here

* First develop as web-app, use Android Studio (XML and Java) for mobile application version later.
